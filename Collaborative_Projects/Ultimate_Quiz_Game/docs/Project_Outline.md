## 🚀 Git Workflow Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup \& Individual Branches (Week 1)

**Day 1-2: Repository Setup**

- Teacher creates project structure
- Students clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/mkpatel3-github/Python_Classwork`
- Each student creates their feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[component-name]`
- Students explore codebase and understand their role

**Sample Commands:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mkpatel3-github/Python_Classwork
cd Python_Classwork/Collaborative_Projects/Ultimate_Quiz_Game

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/game-engine  # (each student uses their component)
git push -u origin feature/game-engine

# Check your branch
git branch
git status
```


### Phase 2: Individual Development (Weeks 2-3)

**Week 2: Core Function Development**

- Each student implements their primary functions
- Daily commits with descriptive messages
- Push progress to their feature branch

**Week 3: Integration Preparation**

- Students complete their components
- Write basic tests for their functions
- Update documentation
- Prepare for code review

**Daily Development Cycle:**

```bash
# Start your work session
git status
git pull origin feature/game-engine

# Work on your code, then save progress
git add .
git commit -m "Implement display_title function with colorful output"
git push origin feature/game-engine

# Check what you've done
git log --oneline
```


### Phase 3: Code Review \& Pull Requests (Week 4)

**Pull Request Creation:**

- Each student creates a pull request for their component
- Write clear PR descriptions explaining their work
- Request specific team members as reviewers

**Code Review Process:**

- Each student reviews at least 2 other components
- Provide constructive feedback
- Ask questions about code they don't understand
- Suggest improvements

**Sample PR Workflow:**

```bash
# Make sure your branch is up to date
git checkout feature/game-engine
git rebase origin/main

# Create pull request via GitHub web interface
# Address feedback by updating code
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback: improve error handling"
git push origin feature/game-engine
```


### Phase 4: Integration \& Conflict Resolution (Week 5)

**Integration Strategy:**

- Merge components one at a time
- Test integration after each merge
- Resolve conflicts collaboratively

**Conflict Resolution Practice:**

- Work together to resolve merge conflicts
- Learn when to use merge vs. rebase
- Practice collaborative problem-solving

**Sample Conflict Resolution:**

```bash
# Prepare for integration
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/game-engine
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them
# Edit conflicted files, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Push updated branch
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/game-engine
```


### Phase 5: Testing \& Refinement (Week 6)

**Collaborative Testing:**

- Test complete game as a team
- Find and fix bugs together
- Implement additional features

**Advanced Git Skills:**

- Use `git blame` to find who wrote specific code
- Practice `git stash` for temporary changes
- Learn `git cherry-pick` for specific commits


### Phase 6: Final Integration \& Deployment (Week 7)

**Release Preparation:**

- Create a release branch
- Final testing and documentation
- Tag the release version

**Celebration \& Reflection:**

- Demo the complete game
- Reflect on collaboration challenges
- Plan next project improvements
